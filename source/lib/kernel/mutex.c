/**
 * @file
 * @brief		Mutex implementation.
 *
 * This implementation is based around the "Mutex, take 3" implementation in
 * the paper linked below. The futex has 3 states:
 *  - 0 - Unlocked.
 *  - 1 - Locked, no waiters.
 *  - 2 - Locked, one or more waiters.
 *
 * Reference:
 *  - Futexes are Tricky
 *    http://dept-info.labri.fr/~denis/Enseignement/2008-IR/Articles/01-futex.pdf
 *
 * @todo		Make this fair.
 * @fixme		Timeout is not handled correctly in the loop.
